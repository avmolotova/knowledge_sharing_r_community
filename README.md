# knowledge_sharing_r_community

This repository contains a code for the quantitative and text analysis and database which were prepared as a part of my bachelor's project. The topic of the project is "Patterns Of Knowledge Sharing In The R Community: Mailing Lists Vs. Stack Overflow Communication". It analyses the activity in both channels and the discussions that appear there.
